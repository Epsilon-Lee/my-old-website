        <h3>Research</h3>
	<p>My research interests range from theoretical linguistics, to computational linguistics, and from machine learning to cognitive modelling. As a major in computer science, I can not hold the passion on Artificial Intelligence, however, for me it's still a long journey to achieve human-like AI, but we are on the way.</p>

	<p>For computational linguistics, I am highly motivated to understand the mechanism of human producing coherent text respect to monologue and dialogue. The step-wise speech act involves in these two vessels of communication is quite different, i.e. to convey information which relates to produced ones with local and global individual linguistic intents and interacts with and affects subsequent discourse planning decisions, while to collaborate conversing which coheres with interlocutors' intents, and especially, the process is topic-centered and history-effect vanishing.</p>
	
	<p>However, it's very hard to research these issues within a computation framework. The core research issue arises, as far as I am concerned, is language acquisition, the linguistic competence and performance advocated by Noam Chomsky. Computationally speaking, it's the problem that we haven't find a way to manipulate linguistic symbol within a generic representation that machines could embody. Still not enough, is that we could embed mind in experiencely gained representations, symbolize them and their relationship and use them to plan under goals and outside stimuli. So for me, language is somehow superficial. Language understanding is not only surface analysis but linking knowledge statistically.</p>

	<p>To speak of realism, I am doing my PhD and my current work-on issues are:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Discourse analysis</b>: mainly involves discourse parsing, discourse relation recognition and classification.</li>
	  <li><b>Image captioning</b>: about better describe an image compositionally, and organize dense annotations into coherent longer captions.</li>
	</ul>
