        <h3>How to construct $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$?</h3>
	      <img src="../images/the-starry-night-1889.jpg"/>

      <p>
        <b>Announcement</b>: This is reading notes excerpted from Walter Rudin's <b>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</b>, from Chapter one, with speicial attention on how to construct $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$. This question arised with a theorem's proof in the book <b>Probability Essentials</b> presented as below. 
        <h4>Theorem 2.1.</h4>
        <i>The Borel  $\sigma$-algebra of  $\mathbb{R}$ is generated by intervals of the form $(-\infty, a]$, where $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ ($\mathbb{Q}$ = rationals).</i>
      </p>

      <h3>1. The Proof of $\sqrt{2}$ Is Not A Rational Number</h3>
      <p>
        So first of all, what is a rational number. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number">wikipedia</a>, a <b>rational number</b> is any number that could be represented as the quotient or fraction of two integers, $\frac{p}{q}$. Although, as a causalist, this leads me to question 'What is an interger?', we here not care about its mathematical rigor and assume the axiomatic result.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to prove $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, means to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ can not be expressed as the form $\frac{p}{q}$. We use proof by contradiction here:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>Proof:</b> Suppose $\sqrt{2}$ can be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$. More formally, the assumption can be written as: $\exists p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, \sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$. Then, $\sqrt{2} q = p \Rightarrow 2q^2 = p^2$. So there exits p, q such that $2p^2 = q^2$ holds. When problem reduces to equation of integers, the use of parity is always turned to. <s>If q is odd, so does $q^2$, the equality will not hold, since the lefthand side of the equal should be even. So q is even.</s> Let $p = 2^{i}k$, $q=2^{j}l$, where $k, l$ are odd and $j > 0$. According to the equality, we have: $2 * 2^{2i}k^2 = 2^{2j}l^2$. That is: $2^{2i+1-2j}k^2 = l^2$. It is impossible, since $k, l$ are odd, and $2i+1-2j \ne 0$. So the assumption is not true. $\square$

      <h3>2. Ordered Set, (Least) Upper Bound, (Greatest) Lower Bound</h3>
      <p>
        <u><b>Definition 'Order':</b></u> an order is a relation $R=\{<,=,>\}$ over a set, such that only three specific relationships hold between any x and y in the set and each of them is transitive, denoted as $xRy$.
      </p>
      <p>
        So an Ordered Set $S$ is a set where an order is defined. Since $S$ is an ordered set, we could define bounds for its subset $E \subset S$. If there exists $\beta \in S$ such that $x \le \beta$ for every $x \in E$, we say that $E$ is bounded above and $\beta$ is an <b>Upper Bound</b> of $E$. Lower can be defined similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if for any $\gamma < \beta$ and $\gamma \in S$, $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$, then $\beta$ is the <b>Least Upper Bound</b> of set $E$, which is denoted as $\beta$ = sup$E$. Greatest lower bound can be defined in the similar way, and is denoted by $\beta$ = inf$E$
      </p>
      <p>
        An ordered set $S$ is said to have <b>least-upper-bound property</b> if for any subset $E \in S$ and $E \ne \phi$, if $E$ is bounded above, then $E$ has its least upper bound $\beta$ = sup$E \in S$. Then we could have a theorem that connects the relationship between least upper bound and greatest lower bound.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u><b>Theorem:</b></u> Suppose $S$ is a set that has least-upper-bound property. If $E \in S$ is bounded below and we denote all possible lower bounds of $E$ as a set $L$. According to the least-upper-bound property of $S$, suppose the least uppper bound of $L$ is $\alpha$ = sup$L$. Then we have: $\alpha$ = inf$E$.

      <h3>3. Field and Ordered Field</h3>
      <p>
        <u><b>Definition 'Field':</b></u> A <i>field</i> is a set $F$ with two operations, i.e. <i>addition, multiplication</i>, which satisfies the following field axioms:
      </br>
      </br>
        (A) Axioms for addition
        <ol>
          <li>(A1) If $x, y \in F$, then their sum $x + y \in F$.</li>
          <li>(A2) Addition is commutative, i.e. $x + y = y + x$.</li>
          <li>(A3) Addition is associative, i.e. $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$.</li>
          <li>(A4) $F$ contains an element 0 such that $0 + x = x$ for every $x \in F$.</li>
          <li>(A5) To every $x \in F$ corresponds an element  $-x \in F$ such that $x + -x = 0$.</li>
        </ol>
        (M) Axioms for multiplication
        <ol>
          <li>(M1) If $x, y \in F$, then their sum $x y \in F$.</li>
          <li>(M2) Addition is commutative, i.e. $x y = y  x$.</li>
          <li>(M3) Addition is associative, i.e. $x  (y  z) = (x  y)  z$.</li>
          <li>(M4) $F$ contains an element 1 such that $1  x = x$ for every $x \in F$.</li>
          <li>(M5) To every $x \in F$ corresponds an element  $1/x \in F$ such that $x  (1/x) = 1$.</li>
        </ol>
        (D) Distributive Law  
        $$x(y + z) = xy + xz$$
        holds for all $x, y, z \in F$.
